My approach to solving the task:

- start with setup, build and deploy. An actual page with only a "Hello world" message is better than: "everything done
  and works, but only on my machine."
- do not even try to run for the most visible and major part of the test assignment (Maps). Remove everything that you can remove from a list of requirements.
- concentrate on more or less good basic implementation but with a possibility to extend it.
- work with actual data as much and as soon as it is possible. (Do not even try to create a prototype on fake data)
- app correctness is important
